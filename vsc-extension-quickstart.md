# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension
* `package.json` - This is the manifest file for the extension.
* * Declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into you extension
* * Defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* * Declare your extension and command. The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name.
	With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
* `snippets/snippets.json` - The file containing all snippets
* `syntaxes/Papyrus.tmLanguage` - This is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization
* `papyrus-configuration.json` - This the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.
* `src/extension.ts` - This is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
	The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is
	activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
	We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to
`registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away
* Make sure the language configuration settings in `papyrus-configuration.json` are accurate
* press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language
* verify that syntax highlight works and that the language configuration settings are working

* run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`
* set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension
* find output from your extension in the debug console

## Make changes
* you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above
* you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Explore the API
* you can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/vscode/vscode.d.ts`

## Run tests
* open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Launch Tests`
* press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded
* see the output of the test result in the debug console
* make changes to `test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder
    * by convention, the test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`
    * you can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want

## Add more language features
* To add features such as intellisense, hovers and validators check out the VS Code extenders documentation at

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the <user home>/.vscode/extensions folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
